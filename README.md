# PIAT

In this folder PIAT models of LSTM and Transformer are presented.

*LSTM.ipynb* and *Transformer.ipynb* notebooks contain the code itself, links and the process of reasoning leading to subsequent trials.

*LSTM - attempts description.docx* and *Transformer - attempts description.docs* documents describe shortly the dataset, model, parameters used for each attempt made and present sample results.

The best models (in my opinion) have been uploaded to OneDrive:
- LSTM (attempt 10, first model):
